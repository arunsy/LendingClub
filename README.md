- The loan application whose loan term of 36 months is charged off than 60 months term.
- In December high number of loan application is processed and June is the lowest.
- When the loan applicant has higher Debit to Income (DTI), they apply for high loan amount. In this scenario the loan applicant will be more default of loan.
- Applicant who has less than a year employed apply for high loan amount. So the loan application can scrutinise or reject the application.
- The applicants who apply loan for "small business, credit card, major purchase, renewable energy" purpose has high charged off. So for new application who apply on this purpose has high chance of defaulting to loan.
- The loan applicants from these state WA, WI, OK, KS, RI has high number of charged off and new application can be scrutinised for this scenario.
